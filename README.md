Controlling Minecraft thru Python script in pynput, having keyboard inputs from the script. Then maybe a smart action where we switch different items based off what the screen is looking at.

For windows. Pynput library.

Do "pip installp pynput". When you want to run a file from your terminal, do "python keyboard.py" or "python mouse.py".
